## Purpose

Paira is a modular engine for constructing custom workflows for matching unstructured financial flows (such as withdrawals and deposits).  
It combines **Domain-Driven Design** with ideas from **Elegant Objects**, focusing on clarity, composition, and immutability.

## Philosophy

Instead of deriving structure from tables or controllers, Paira is designed from behavior and domain language.  
It avoids `null`, `static`, and shared mutable state in favor of explicit models and scenario-driven design.

## Installation

_Composer support will be added soon._
