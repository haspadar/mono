# Paira

> An asynchronous P2P matching engine for pairing withdrawals with deposits.

## Status

ðŸš§ Under active development.

## Purpose

Paira is a modular engine for constructing custom workflows for matching unstructured financial flows (such as withdrawals and deposits).  
It combines **Domain-Driven Design** with ideas from **Elegant Objects**, focusing on clarity, composition, and immutability.

## Philosophy

Instead of deriving structure from tables or controllers, Paira is designed from behavior and domain language.  
It avoids `null`, `static`, and shared mutable state in favor of explicit models and scenario-driven design.

## Installation

_Composer support will be added soon._

## Testing and Coverage

Paira uses [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) to track test coverage. Ensure that all new code is covered by tests to maintain high quality and reliability. You can view the coverage reports on Codecov's website.

To integrate Codecov with your development workflow, install the [Codecov GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/codecov) for automated coverage reporting.
